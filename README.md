# XPEEM_toolkit
Python scripts for processing and visualisation of XPEEM spectromicroscopy data.

# Description
This projects is an XPEEM toolkit for image alignment, E-stack correction, E-stack analysis, 2E analysis and multivariate analysis (given in the Associated content section). This is a first version that we will improve to make the code easier to use for scientists without coding experience.

The main functions of the code were detailed in the following manuscript, please cite it if reusing the functions in whole or in part:
